[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 2 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 2 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

- I added one image to the "Welcome" section on the "Home" page to fill the empty space to the left of the text.
- I deleted one image per section on the "Vendors" page so that I can style them to all be in the audience's eyesight right away. It will work better for my narrow screen design as well because users won't have to scroll a lot.
- I changed some of the images because they would be more aesthetically consistent.

## Entire Website's Narrow Design
> Plan the design of the website for narrow screens.
> Include a sketch for each page of your website.
> Include the design of the _entire_ page, not just the top portion.
> Label each sketch, so that we understand what page we are reviewing. (1 short phrase per sketch)

![Home2](apple-home-2.jpg)
![Vendors1](apple-vendors-1.jpg)
![Vendors2](apple-vendors-2.jpg)
![Vendors3](apple-vendors-3.jpg)
![Performances1](apple-performances-1.jpg)
![Performances2](apple-performances-2.jpg)
![Directions-Transportation1](apple-directions-transportation-1.jpg)
![Directions-Transportation2](apple-directions-transportation-2.jpg)

I put the sidebar on the top of the main content in narrow screen because I want to highlight the content in the sidebar. Putting it at that position makes more sense for the reading flow of the users.

## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

During this assignment, the most important thing I've learned is designing with fluid responsiveness in mind. To do that, I need to resize/scale images and use CSS media queries to ensure a seamless user experience across various screen sizes. Compared to Project 1, I now remember that images should fill 100% of the content width for narrow screens. I also learned to conduct user interviews and design my website to better align with my audience's goals.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

I've considerably improved my skill using the inspector element, which really has helped me with margin/padding and debugging. I feel that I'm more confident with content structuring and more skillful with applying the visual principles to designing. Additionally, I really struggled with using flexbox but now I'm much more confident about it! Although it took me a really long time to design my website, I'm glad I enhanced my patience and problem-solving skills to deliver a polished and user-friendly website.
