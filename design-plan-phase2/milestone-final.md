# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

## Interactivity Usability Justification

The hamburger menu helps save space for narrow screens, allowing users to see the festival information immediately; the modals enabled them to better view images of signature items and gain more detailed information about them to better plan their outing at the festival. The hamburger button signals that users can interact with it, while the X icon buttons indicate closure for both the menu and modals (both are styled as clickable using cursor: pointer). The open action is visible with the hamburger button for the menu and with the hover effect on the thumbnails for the modals; the close action is visible with the X icon buttons for both. For feedback, the hamburger menu and the modals show instantly when the hamburger button and the corresponding thumbnails are clicked, respectively. Closing actions are also immediate when clicking the X icon. The familiar design of the hamburger menu for narrow-screen navigation and the well-known use of modals for displaying additional content without leaving the current page make them pretty intuitive for users. Most users are also accustomed to closing the hamburger menu or the modals via an X icon.

## Self-Reflection

I've learned to add interactivity that serve users' goals while also fulfilling the criteria of affordances, functionality, visibility, familiarity, and feedback. I've also learned to how to tailor the interactivity features to suit various screen widths for better responsive design.

> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

It's cool that now I know how to combine 3 layers (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to design a polished website. I also found that drawing sketches for interactivity really helped me envisioning the pseudocodes and then actually implementing the codes in JavaScript. I'm also proud of myself because I'm now even more mindful of accessibility and responsive design, ensuring that my websites are easy to use across different devices and screen sizes.
