# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I made changes to my "Pseudocode to show/hide (toggle) the navigation menu (narrow screens) when the hamburger button is clicked" because the original one didn't work well when I actually coded in JavaScript.

## Interactivity Usability Justification
> Explain how the interactivity _functionally_ improves the user's experience and helps them accomplish their goals. (i.e. Your interactivity does _more_ than add additional clicks; the interactivity doesn't insert additional barriers for the user when working towards their goals.)
> Explain how your interactivity's design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a paragraph (3-4 sentences)

The hamburger menu helsp save space for narrow screens, allowing users to see the festival information immediately; the modals enabled them to better view images of signature items and gain more detailed information about them to better plan their outing at the festival. The hamburger button signals that users can interact with it, while the X icon buttons indicate closure for both the menu and modals (both are styled as clickable using cursor: pointer). The open action is visible with the hamburger button for the menu and with the hover effect on the thumbnails for the modals; the close action is visible with the X icon buttons for both. For feedback, the hamburger menu and the modals show instantly when the hamburger button and the corresponding thumbnails are clicked, respectively. Closing actions are also immediate when clicking the X icon. The familiar design of the hamburger menu for narrow-screen navigation and the well-known use of modals for displaying additional content without leaving the current page make them pretty intuitive for users. Most users are also accustomed to closing the hamburger menu or the modals via an X icon.


## Tell Us What to Grade
> We aren't re-grading your entire Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added to the project.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed here, we won't grade it. **No exceptions.**

- My hamburger menu is on all 5 pages. Click the hamburger icon on any page to open the navigation menu. To close it, click the X icon that appears in place of the hamburger icon.
- My modals are on the "Home" page, specifically the "Signature Items" section. Hover over a thumbnail and click it to open a modal with more details. To close the modal, click the X icon in the corner.

## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

I've learned to add interactivity that serve users' goals while also fulfilling the criteria of affordances, functionality, visibility, familiarity, and feedback. I've also learned to how to tailor the interactivity features to suit various screen widths for better responsive design.

> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

It's cool that now I know how to combine 3 layers (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to design a polished website. I also found that drawing sketches for interactivity really helped me envisioning the pseudocodes and then actually implementing the codes in JavaScript. I'm also proud of myself because I'm now even more mindful of accessibility and responsive design, ensuring that my websites are easy to use across different devices and screen sizes.
