# Overview
This project was my second assignment for my class INFO 1300: Introductory Design and Programming for the Web. For this project, I re-designed and coded a responsive and interactive website for Ithaca's Apple Harvest Festival. 

There were 2 phases in this project. 
1. Static, Fully Responsive Website (HTML and CSS only)
2. Interactive Website (JavaScript added)

# Phase 1: Static, Fully Responsive Website (HTML and CSS)
Using only HTML and CSS, I developed a static website that is fully responsive for both wide and narrow screens.

## Milestone 1: User Research and Planning 
- Conducted user research interviews to identify the target audience and their goals for the website.
- Planned and organized the website’s content to align with audience needs.
- Created design sketches for the website layout, optimized for wide screens.
- Developed a draft version of the website with only content and minimal styling.

## Milestone 2: Wide Screen Implementation 
- Designed the website layout, including flexboxes for the navigation bar and sidebar.
- Implemented a polished version of the website optimized for wide screens.

## Final Milestone: Fully Responsive Website
- Planned and sketched the website’s layout for narrow screens. 
- Implemented a fully responsive website using media queries and other responsive design methods. 
- Scaled image files.

# Phase 2: Interactive Website (JavaScript Added)
Building on the static website, I added client-side interactivity using JavaScript to improve functionality and usability. Key features included:
- A hamburger drop-down navigation menu for streamlined navigation on narrow screen devices.
- A modal to display additional information and content without leaving the current page.

## Milestone 1: Design and Plan Interactivity
- Brainstormed multiple ideas for incorporating modals.
- Created and annotated design sketches.
- Justified how the interactivity features enhance the website’s usability and help the audience achieve their goals.
- Planned the implementation of interactivity with planning sketches and pseudocode.
- Added the necessary HTML and CSS elements to prepare for interactivity.
 

## Final Milestone: Functional Client-Side Interactivity
- Coded the interactivity using JavaScript.
- Explained how the interactive features met the principles of affordances, feedback, visibility, and familiarity.
