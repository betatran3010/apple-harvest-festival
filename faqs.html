            <dl class="questions">
                <!-- Source: instructor provided -->
                <dt> How much money should I bring? </dt>
                <dd> Entry to the event is completely free! The amount of money you should bring is dependent on what, if anything, you wish to purchase at the festival. If you are driving, there is a $5 charge to park at the parking garage (You can find more parking information here ). If you plan to eat at the festival, you may also wish to bring at least $10. Prices of the various baked goods, produce, and crafts vary by vendor. Many of our vendors and their items can be found here. </dd>

                <!-- Source: instructor provided -->
                <dt> Can I pay with a credit card? </dt>
                <dd> Most of our vendors accept credit cards, however, you should bring some cash in case a shop you are interested in does not accept them. </dd>

                <!-- Source: (original work) Tran Le -->
                <dt> Is the festival still open in case of rain? </dt>
                <dd> Yes! Vendors will continue selling their products. They will set up tents or canopies to protect their items but they will still serve the attendees. Our volunteers will try our best to help the vendors effectively showcase the items even if they are covered up. However, performances may be canceled. </dd>

                <!-- Source: (original work) Tran Le -->
                <dt> What weather-related preparations should I make for the festival? </dt>
                <dd> To prepare for the festival, it's important to check the weather forecast beforehand. The weather forecast currently shows that it won't rain on the festival dates, but since there was rain on the prior days, we highly recommend you bring an umbrella. If you think bringing an umbrella is unwieldy, it is advisable to bring waterproof clothing, such as a rain jacket or poncho, and consider wearing waterproof shoes. But don't worry too much, if you forget these items, you can go buy them at a cheap price in many stores around the festival! </dd>

                <!-- Source: instructor provided -->
                <dt> When is the best time to attend? </dt>
                <dd> If you are looking to avoid the crowds, attending midday Friday is a good idea. However, many attendees find that the crowds on the weekend add to the energy and fun of the festival. </dd>
